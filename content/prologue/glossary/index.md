While working in the Kerberos Ecosystem, specific words and sentences become to start feel natural. Unfortunately that's not the case for everyone, that's why we added and updated this glossary page, to anyone can come back to this if he would require more detailed explanation.

## Agent

An agent is a collection of binaries, shipped in different forms such as Docker, Balena, etc). It executes specific tasks related to the camera processing, monitoring, configuration and reviewing.

There are two types of agents: an Open Source agent and an Enterprise agent.

### Open Source agent

The Open Source agent is a binary, shipped in different forms such as docker, KiOS, source code, which is Open Source and can be used for any purpose (commercial and non-commercial).
