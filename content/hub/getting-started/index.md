You might wonder what is inside the Kerberos Hub solution? We'll provide you a concrete list of functionalities below, this should give you more insights about how Kerberos Hub looks like and what the capabilities are.

## Secured storage

Kerberos Hub allows you to store your data in the cloud, and make it available using a secured web interface. This is how it works.

Once you've installed a Kerberos agent, and created an account on [Kerberos Hub](https://cloud.kerberos.io), you will be able to connect both systems together. By entering credentials received from Kerberos Hub, into your Kerberos agent, your media recordings will be send to our cloud storage.

> You can link one or more Kerberos agents to your Kerberos Hub account.

After linking your media recorded by a Kerberos agent will be send to our secure cloud storage, Kerberos Vault. By default our own [Kerberos Vault](/storage/introduction) service is used, however you can install your own [Kerberos Vault](/storage/introduction) and link it to our public cloud. By doing this all the recordings are stored in your own datacenter of choice, and only metadata is stored inside Kerberos Hub.

Once stored your media recordings will be processed by different functions and algorithms to send alerts, apply machine learning and much more.

> Kerberos Hub is much more than a storage service, you get intelligent capabilities as well. Read on to discover more.

## Consolidated overview

Kerberos Hub will group your media recordings (coming from one or more Kerberos agents) into time bundles. We do this to simplify the searching of a specific event. Less data is shown at once, and when needed you can drill down a level deeper to see more details.

{{< figure src="overview.png" alt="The media page gives you an overview of all your recordings." caption="The media page gives you an overview of all your recordings." class="stretch">}}

In a sneak peek you will see how many media recordings were generated during a certain time period, and which Kerberos agents were involved. For example, this might give you an indication of a particular event (more about in the machine learning section).

### Security

Once you're inside your Kerberos Hub account, you will see all the available media recordings of your Kerberos agents in a single interface. So how does this work?

When you open Kerberos Hub we will generate temporary and private links for every media recording within your account. This link includes a random and unique hash, and is only available for a couple of minutes. So this means that your recording cannot be shared afterwards, or the risk someone else accessing that link is minimised.

## Advanced searching

Next to showing all your recordings in one overview, we also give you the capabilities to search for a recording more easily. For example you can search for recordings within a specific time boundary, recordings generated by a specific Kerberos agent, recordings which are marked as important, classified recordings such as pedestrians or animals, and more.

## Machine learning

With Kerberos Hub you will get far more than just a nice interface for finding back your recordings. When a recording is uploaded to Kerberos Hub, we will execute all kind of algorithms. One of these algorithms is classification. This algorithm is used to classify/recognise all the objects inside your recording. Any human, vehicle or animal in the recording will be labeled.

Next to classifying, the algorithm is also tracing the classified objects. By doing this we can label the recording with the object of interest. For example at the image below you see the traject of a pedestrian walking by (710 pixels).

## Alerts

When a specific event occurred, a notification can be send to one or more channels. A user can compose an event by selecting one or more conditions. Once the event is triggered, a notification is sent to all the enabled channels.

### Alerts

Kerberos Hub supports different types of alerts:

- **Detections**: send a notification if a recording was received from a specific Kerberos agent, within a time range, with a specific classification, etc.
- **Devices**: when one of your Kerberos agents stopped working, a notification can be send.
- **High upload**: when a lot of recordings are generated within a specific period of time, a notification can be send.

### Channels

Kerberos Hub supports different types of channels, towards notifications can be send:

- **Browser**: notifications inside the browser (if the used browser supports this).
- **E-mail**: a personal email can be send.
- **Slack**: send a message to a slack channel.
- **Alexa**: send a notification to Alexa skill ([Notify Me](https://www.amazon.com/Thomptronics-Notify-Me/dp/B07BB2FYFS)).
- **Telegram**: send a message to a Telegram channel.
- **Pushbullet**: send a message to a Pushbullet channel.
- **Pushover**: send a message to a Pushover channel.
- **Webhook**: trigger a webhook (POST).
- **IFTTT**: send a message to IFTTT.
- **SMS**: send a text message to a mobile number.

## Livestreaming

Kerberos Hub allows you to live stream from your Kerberos agents to your Kerberos Hub account.

For Kerberos Open Source a low resolution livestream is made available, this will allow you to see what is happening in front of your surveillance camera in real-time. The stream is shared over MQTT (TCPS) and visualised in the Kerberos Hub webinterface using secure websockets (WSS). No port forwarding needs to be enabled.

{{< figure src="livestream.png" alt="A Kerberos agent will give you access to the livestream, and a HD stream when using the enterprise agent." caption="A Kerberos agent will give you access to the livestream, and a HD stream when using the enterprise agent." class="stretch">}}

For Kerberos Enterprise a HD livestream is made available. The full resolution and FPS is send through a concept called WebRTC. This WebRTC technology, is used my all major conferencing tools such as Zoom, Teams, etc.

## Accounts

It's possible to create multiple accounts (also called subaccounts) within your main account. Their are two different roles:

- Guest: will only see your media recordings. A guest cannot modify, delete or create something.
- Editor: has full access, same permissions as the main account.
