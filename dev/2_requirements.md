## Which hardware do I need?

Kerberos.io is created for the **Rapsberry Pi**. So it is obvious you will need a Raspberry Pi before you can start using Kerberos. However you can also use Kerberos.io on your local environment, but of course that is not the main goal of Kerberos.
You can select which Raspberry Pi model you need: **Raspberry Pi Model A, A+, B, B+ or Raspberry Pi 2**.

You need a **4GB or bigger SD card**, on which you will have to deploy the Kerberos.io image; look at the installation page for more information about the deployment.

A **micro USB 5V** charger.

A **USB camera** or the **Raspberry Pi camera** module.

*(Optional)* We can use a **WIFI dongle** instead of an ethernet cable, but this is not required. We recommend the **Edimax**  ew-7811un WIFI dongle.

*(Optional)* The **Scorpi B+**, a flexible Mount for the Raspberry Pi Camera Board.
