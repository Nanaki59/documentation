# Requirements

## Which hardware do I need?

Kerberos.io runs on every machine but its main goal is to run on a **Raspberry Pi**. Therefore there are multiple ways (KIOS, Raspbian, Docker, etc) to install Kerberos.io on your specific device, it's your choice. If you want to run Kerberos.io on a Raspberry Pi you'll first need to buy some hardware.

### Raspberry Pi 

As said, you can run Kerberos.io **on every machine**, however we recommend to run Kerberos.io on a **Raspberry Pi**, as it is a low-budget microcontroller which can you buy in almost every electronic shop. Besides that Kerberos.io comes with a custom OS called **KIOS** (Kerberos.io Operating System), which you can deploy to your Raspberry Pi in just a few minutes. Kerberos.io supports **all Raspberry Pi versions** (1, 2 and 3).

### SD card

If you want to use your Raspberry Pi, you will need to have a SD card, on which an OS will be installed. Therefore you will need a **2GB or bigger SD card**.

### Power supply 

You will need to have a **micro USB 5V** charger, to give the Raspberry Pi some juice.

### Camera

Kerberos.io works with the full range of camera's. You can use an **USB-**, **IP-** or the **Raspberry Pi camera**.

### Optional 

You can use a **WIFI dongle** instead of an ethernet cable, but this is not required. We recommend the **Edimax** ew-7811un WIFI dongle; this is not necessary for the Raspberry Pi 3 as this is built-in.
