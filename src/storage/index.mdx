# Storage

Kerberos Open Source and Kerberos Enterprise both store recordings on the local disk. If you want to persist data on premise, additional solutions are available.

1. You can store your data directly on [Kerberos Cloud](/cloud).
2. Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC), you can store data on premise, private cloud or public cloud.

## Kerberos Cloud

Within Kerberos Open Source an Kerberos Enterprise you can choose to send your local recordings to our cloud environment. This means that your data will be hosted and processed (metadata, machine learning) in a Kerberos Cloud datacenter. For more information about how Kerberos Cloud works [can be found here](/cloud).

## Bring Your Own Cloud

If you are using Kerberos Enterprise you have the possibility to bring your own cloud. By installing Kerberos Storage you can send your recordings to your own datacenter, private or public cloud. Following providers are supported:

  - [Google Cloud Platform Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
  - [Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/)
  - [Amazon Web Services S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

### Events

Next to uploading and persisting data, Kerberos Storage can also trigger events. Each time a recording is send to Kerberos Storage an event can be triggered through one of the following providers.

  - [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
  - [Amazon Web Services SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)

Those events can be fetched or subscribed by custom applications. For example, one can create a notifications service, machine learning service or an entire cloud application. Allowing you to leverage the power and scalability of Kerberos Enterprise, and building and focussing on your specific application.

## Licensing

Kerberos Storage is publicly available and **requires a license key** to operate correctly. Reach out to **cedric@verstraeten.io** for the commercial matters.
