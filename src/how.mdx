# How it works

The Kerberos Agent comes in two flavors, Kerberos Open Source and Kerberos Enterprise. If we write Kerberos Agent, this means that we have service running (either Open Source of Enterprise) for processing a camera feed.

### Front-End
The Kerberos Agent ships with a Web interface (Front-End) and a video processing engine (Back-End). The Front-End allows a user to modify specific settings, and if Kerberos Open Source, watch recordings in a easy-to-use interface; The Front-End for Kerberos Enterprise is used for configuration only.

### Back-End
The Back-End piece of the Kerberos Agent is a service that processes the camera feed with computer vision algorithms to detect motion, and makes recordings and/or execute specific actions. Kerberos Enterprise supports any type of IP-camera (RTSP/ONVIF), and Kerberos Open Source also adds support for USB (V4L2) and the popular Raspberry Pi camera.

Depending on which Kerberos Agent, Kerberos Open Source or Kerberos Enterprise, you will have different installation methods. If you would like to learn more about the Kerberos Agent, have a look in the related sections: [Open Source](/opensource/introduction), [Enterprise](/enterprise/introduction).

## Open Source vs Enterprise

The Kerberos project started as an Open Source project, with a main focus on low-cost devices such as the Raspberry Pi. Later on the Open Source version was bundled inside the Docker technology so that it was easier to distribute. Anyone can use the Open Source version for personal usage.

Enterprises are more demanding, and have a lot of surveillance cameras, therefore they need a scalable surveillance system. The [Enterprise edition](/enterprise/introduction) of Kerberos allows you to operate a video surveillance cluster (Kubernetes) on-premise or in the cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).

The Open Source and Enterprise edition are significantly different from a source code point of view. The [Enterprise edition](/enterprise/introduction) is a complete rewrite of the Open Source version, and got all the best practices we discovered over the years implemented. Both version are and will remain updated in the future.

## Storage

## Cloud

When installing a Kerberos agent inside your local network, it's possible to review your activity by using the agent's web interface. By its nature, you will not be able to access the web interface from the cloud (outside your local network). On top of that, the Kerberos agent doesn't come with a consolidated overview. This means that you will need to open multiple web interfaces, one for each connected surveillance camera. To simplify and resolve all of these challenges, [Kerberos Cloud](/cloud) was developed.
