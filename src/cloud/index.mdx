# Cloud

When installing a Kerberos agent inside your local network, it's possible to review your activity by using the agent's web interface. By nature, you will not be able to access the web interface from the cloud (outside your local network). On top of that, the Kerberos agent doesn't come with a consolidated overview. This means that you will need to open multiple web interfaces, one for each connected surveillance camera.

To simplify and resolve all of these challenges, Kerberos Cloud was developed.

> [Kerberos Cloud](https://cloud.kerberos.io) is a cloud solution which allows you to have a single overview of all the media recordings generated by your surveillance cameras. It's not a solution for processing your surveillance cameras in the cloud. For processing of your surveillance cameras, a Kerberos agent is used.

A brief list of the key features of Kerberos Cloud are:

- Secured storage
- Consolidated overview
- Advanced searching
- Machine learning
- Alerts
- Live streaming
- Accounts
- Logging

> Checkout [the demo environment](https://app-demo.kerberos.io) to see and feel the Kerberos Cloud solution yourself.

## Architecture

A simplified architecture is found below. In this architecture the Kerberos agents are installed on-premise, next to the surveillance cameras. Once one of the agents recorded something it will send the recording to our AWS S3 bucket, using the credentials you've defined inside the agent.

As soon as the recording is succesfully received several engines will be executed, that will further process the recording and extract metadata from it (classification, origin of the surveillance camera, etc). A lot of processing is happening behind the scenes (by what we call microservices).

By using a browser you can navigate to Kerberos Cloud, and review all the recordings made by the Kerberos agents. On top of that you will receive more context about the recordings, get notifications, view a livestream and much more.

### Public or Private edition

They are two different versions of using and deploying Kerberos Cloud, we have the public and private dition. What's the difference?

The Public edition of Kerberos Cloud, is running all its services in what we often call the public cloud; and to be more specific on AWS and GCP. The Public cloud is mainly built for people who want to have a low cost and small scale VMS in the cloud. It's easy to (un)subscribe to the system, and you can connect your Kerberos agents in a matter of seconds.

On the other hand we also have the private edition, which is available for enterprises. In contrary to the public edition, a customer can deploy the entire Kerberos Cloud platform (with all its microservices) where it wants (on-premise or cloud). Both public and private edition are built on Kubernetes, this means that you will need to
have a Kubernetes cluster available at the location you which to install Kerberos Cloud.

For more information about the licensing of Kerberos Cloud private edition, please get in touch with cedric@verstraeten.io. The licensing model of Kerberos Cloud public edition can be found online.

## Features

So you might wonder, what's actually inside the platform? Please find a concrete list of functionalities below, this should give you more insights about how it looks like and what the capabilities are.

## Secured storage

Kerberos Cloud allows you to store your data in the cloud, and make it available using a secured web interface. This is how it works.

Once you've installed a Kerberos agent, and created an account on [Kerberos Cloud](https://cloud.kerberos.io), you will be able to connect both systems together. By entering credentials received from Kerberos Cloud, into your Kerberos agent, your media recordings will be send to our cloud storage.

> You can link one or more Kerberos agents to your Kerberos Cloud account.

![cloud linking](../../public/images/kerberos-cloud-linking.png)

After linking your media recorded by a Kerberos agent will be send to a secure cloud storage, AWS S3 (multiple regions are supported). By default our own S3 buckets are used, however we can negotiate to have your own S3 bucket (open a support ticket).

![cloud](../../public/images/kerberos-network-onprem.png)

Once stored your media recordings will be processed by different functions and algorithms to send alerts, apply machine learning and much more.

> Kerberos Cloud is much more than a storage service, you get intelligent capabilities as well. Read on to discover more.

## Consolidated overview

Kerberos Cloud will group your media recordings (coming from one or more Kerberos agents) into time bundles. We do this to simplify the searching of a specific event. Less data is shown at once, and when needed you can drill down a level deeper to see more details.

![cloud overview](../../public/images/kerberos-cloud-overview.png)

In a sneak peek you will see how many media recordings were generated during a certain time period, and which Kerberos agents were involved. For example, this might give you an indication of a particular event (more about in the machine learning section).

### Security

Once you're inside your Kerberos Cloud account, you will see all the available media recordings of your Kerberos agents in a single interface. So how does this work?

When you open Kerberos Cloud we will generate temporary and private links for every media recording within your account. This link includes a random and unique hash, and is only available for a couple of minutes. So this means that your recording cannot be shared afterwards, or the risk someone else accessing that link is minimised.

## Advanced searching

Next to showing all your recordings in one overview, we also give you the capabilities to search for a recording more easily. For example you can search for recordings within a specific time boundary, recordings generated by a specific Kerberos agent, recordings which are marked as important, classified recordings such as pedestrians or animals, and more.

![cloud search](../../public/images/kerberos-cloud-search.png)

## Machine learning

With Kerberos Cloud you will get far more than just a nice interface for finding back your recordings. When a recording is uploaded to Kerberos Cloud, we will execute all kind of algorithms. One of these algorithms is classification. This algorithm is used to classify/recognise all the objects inside your recording. Any human, vehicle or animal in the recording will be labeled.

Next to classifying, the algorithm is also tracing the classified objects. By doing this we can label the recording with the object of interest. For example at the image below you see the traject of a pedestrian walking by (710 pixels).

## Alerts

When a specific event occurred, a notification can be send to one or more channels. A user can compose an event by selecting one or more conditions. Once the event is triggered, a notification is sent to all the enabled channels.

### Notifications

 Kerberos Cloud supports different types of notifications:

 - **Detections**: send a notification if a recording was received from a specific Kerberos agent, within a time range, with a specific classification, etc.
 - **Devices**: when one of your Kerberos agents stopped working, a notification can be send.
 - **High upload**: when a lot of recordings are generated within a specific period of time, a notification can be send.

![cloud notifications](../../public/images/kerberos-cloud-notifications.png)

### Channels

 Kerberos Cloud supports different types of channels, towards notifications can be send:

 - **Browser**: notifications inside the browser (if the used browser supports this).
 - **E-mail**: a personal email can be send.
 - **Slack**: send a message to a slack channel.
 - **Alexa**: send a notification to Alexa skill ([Notify Me](https://www.amazon.com/Thomptronics-Notify-Me/dp/B07BB2FYFS)).
 - **Telegram**: send a message to a Telegram channel.
 - **Pushbullet**: send a message to a Pushbullet channel.
 - **Pushover**: send a message to a Pushover channel.
 - **Webhook**: trigger a webhook (POST).
 - **IFTTT**: send a message to IFTTT.
 - **SMS**: send a text message to a mobile number.

![cloud notifications](../../public/images/kerberos-cloud-channels.png)

## Live streaming

Kerberos Cloud allows you to live stream from your Kerberos agents to your account. A low resolution livestream (this will be improved in future), will allow you see what is happening in front of your surveillance camera in real-time.

![cloud livestream](../../public/images/kerberos-cloud-livestream.png)

## Accounts

It's possible to create multiple accounts (also called subaccounts) within your main account. Their are two different roles:

- Guest: will only see your media recordings. A guest cannot modify, delete or create something.
- Editor: has full access, same permissions as the main account.

![cloud accounts](../../public/images/kerberos-cloud-accounts.png)

## Logging

All algorithms or functions which are applied to your recording on the Kerberos Cloud platform, are shown on the logging page. You can use this to debug.
