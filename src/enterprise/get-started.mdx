# Get Started

Once you've installed Kerberos Enterprise, you will have the Factory service running inside your cluster, and you will have access to the Factory web application. This web application allows you to administrate your Machinery deployments/pods.

## Login page

Once you open a browser, and navigate to the Factory web application (see installation for the url), you will land on the login page.

The default username password of the Factory web applications is:

- username: **root**
- password: **kerberos**

> The username and password can be changed in the MongoDB database.

## License key

The first time you login you are asked for a license key, this can be obtained by sending a request to cedric@verstraeten.io. An example license key looks like this:

> -----BEGIN LICENSE KEY-----
L/+DAwEBB2xpY2Vuc2UB/4QAAQIBB1BheWxvYWQBCgABCVNpZ25hdHVyZQEKAAAA
/9z/hAFUPBAADG1haW4uTGljZW5zZf+BAwEBB0xpY2Vuc2UB/4IAAQIBB0NvbXBh

-----END LICENSE KEY-----

Once you received a license key, and entered it into the web application you will be redirected to the login screen. Enter your credentials again, and you will be guided into the dashboard.

## Overview

On the overview page you will find an intuitive overview of the different pages and functionalities. On the left menu you will see two sections: **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. Kerberos Enterprise can both run in Docker (single-host) and Kubernetes (cluster) mode, however the recommended way is Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes

On the left menu you will find the Kubernetes section. In this section 3 sub menu's are available:

- Nodes
- Deployments
- Pods

## Nodes

The nodes section lists all the available nodes inside your Kubernetes cluster.

## Deployments

The deployments section will list all the machinery deployments (agents) that you have deployed inside your cluster. It gives you access to deploy new deploments one by one or in bulk.

### Adding a new deployment

There are two options to add a new deployment:
- single deployment

By specifying a name for your deployment and it's corresponding RTSP url, a new deployment will be created for you, and deployed to one of your installed nodes.

![Factory](../../public/images/factory/kerberos-factory-add-single-deployment.png)

- in bulk deployment.

By importing an Excel file, deployments can be created in bulk.

![Factory](../../public/images/factory/kerberos-factory-add-bulk-deployment.png)

By specifying the name and corresponding RTSP url in multiple rows, you can deploy your deployments in bulk.

### Configuring a deployment

Once you have a running deployment, you should see a green circle next to the deployment, indicating that it is succesfully running. At any time you can configure your deployments by clicking on the <SettingsIcon className="pointer"/> icon. This will open a popup, allowing you to change some settings.

![Factory](../../public/images/factory/kerberos-factory-config-region.png)

Following settings can be changed:

- One or more regions of interest,
- Time based conditions,
- Pre- and postrecording

## Pods

When creating a deployment, Kubernetes will create a Pod. This Pod will be deployed to one of your available nodes.
Once a Pod dies, or crashes, the deployment will make sure it is deployed again to a different (or the same) node.

## Storage and video management

Kerberos Enterprise allows you to scale your video landscape horizontally, it stores its recordings locally for a short amount of time. The idea of Kerberos Enterprise is **not** to have a visual component, for example to browse through recordings, and search for specific events.

To make this functionality possible we have integrated (similar to the open source version), Kerberos Enterprise, to [Kerberos Cloud](/cloud). A full featured, and extensive, platform for managing your video surveillance systems.
