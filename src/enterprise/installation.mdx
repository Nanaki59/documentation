# Installation

Kerberos Enterprise can be installed where Kubernetes can be installed. This means that it can run at the Edge - Baremetal -, in the cloud - VMs - or at Kubernetes service providers - SAAS - such as GCP, Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, and the list goes on.

Although you might except Kubernetes at the Edge or Kubernetes in the cloud, there are no differences, well sorry to say there are. As Kubernetes service providers implemented features such as LoadBalancers, Persistent Volumes, and others, they have automated and integrated a huge portion of the Kubernetes stack with their related PAAS services. To be more concrete if you are running a Kubernetes Cluster on GCP, you will use the LoadBalancing and Storage services from GCP.

Compared to Kubernetes at the Edge, there are no predefined LoadBalancers, Storage capabilities, and more. This means more administration work for you, but - with great power comes great responsibility - so no worries. Luckily there is a solution for all the features you find out-of-the-box at the Kubernetes service providers, you just have to spend more time on configuring and installing services/pods/deployments yourself.
