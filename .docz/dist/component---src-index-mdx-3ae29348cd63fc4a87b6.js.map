Kerberos(dot)io can be seen as a kind of security protocol driven by hardware devices such as surveillance cameras.

It comes in two flavors, Kerberos Open Source and Kerberos Enterprise. Kerberos can be deployed to any ARM device, Linux OS, Docker, Balenca Cloud, or cluster such as Kubernetes.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"kerberos-agent\"\n    }}>{`Kerberos Agent`}</h3>\n    <p>{`When you install Kerberos Open Source or Kerberos Enterprise we will refer to it as the Kerberos agent. A Kerberos agent, is a software solution that processes the video stream of a single surveillance camera, makes and visualises recordings and takes actions (for example sending notifications).`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
