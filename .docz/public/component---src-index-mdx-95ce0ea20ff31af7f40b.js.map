Kerberos(dot)io can be seen as a kind of security protocol driven by hardware devices such as surveillance cameras.

Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Nowadays we have a myriad of expensive cameras, recorders, and software solutions which are mainly outdated and difficult to install and use. Kerberos goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being or enterprise in this world to have their own ecological, affordable, easy-to-use and innovative surveillance solution. Read more about our strategy here.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"what-is-kerberos\"\n    }}>{`What is Kerberos`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Kerberos is a video surveillance solution, that uses computer vision algorithms to detect changes, and that can trigger actions (notifications, api, etc). It comes in two flavors, Kerberos Open Source and Kerberos Enterprise. Kerberos can be deployed to any Linux OS, Docker, or cluster such as Kubernetes.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"the-kerberos-agent\"\n    }}>{`The Kerberos agent`}</h2>\n    <p>{`When you install Kerberos Open Source or Kerberos Enterprise we will refer to it as a Kerberos agent. A Kerberos agent, is a software solution that processes the video stream of a single surveillance camera, makes and visualises recordings and takes actions (for example sending notifications).`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"how-does-it-work\"\n    }}>{`How does it work`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The Kerberos agent comes in two flavors, Open Source and Enterprise. Both versions have a web interface (front-end) and a video processing engine (back-end). The front-end allows a user to modify specific settings and watch recordings in a easy-to-use interface. The back-end is a solution that processes the camera feed with computer vision algorithms to detect motion, and makes recordings and/or execute specific actions. Kerberos supports any type of IP-camera (RTSP/ONVIF), USB (V4L2) and the popular Raspberry Pi camera.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Depending on the flavor you choose, you will have to install different components, but the idea as described above remains the same.

Later on the Open Source version was bundled inside the Docker technology so that it was easier to distribute. Anyone can use the Open Source version for personal usage.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Enterprises are more demanding, and have a lot of surveillance cameras, therefore they need a scalable surveillance system. The `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/enterprise/introduction\"\n      }}>{`Enterprise edition`}</a>{` of Kerberos is a licensed service which allows you to operate a video surveillance cluster (Kubernetes) on-premise or in the cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Open Source and Enterprise edition are significantly different from a source code point of view. The `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/enterprise/introduction\"\n      }}>{`Enterprise edition`}</a>{` is a complete rewrite of the Open Source version, and got all the best practices we discovered over the years implemented. Both version are and will remain updated in the future.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"cloud\"\n    }}>{`Cloud`}</h2>\n    <p>{`When installing a Kerberos agent inside your local network, it's possible to review your activity by using the agent's web interface. By its nature, you will not be able to access the web interface from the cloud (outside your local network). On top of that, the Kerberos agent doesn't come with a consolidated overview. This means that you will need to open multiple web interfaces, one for each connected surveillance camera. To simplify and resolve all of these challenges, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/cloud\"\n      }}>{`Kerberos Cloud`}</a>{` was developed.
