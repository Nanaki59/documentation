To centralise your data at a single place, additional solutions are available.
Kerberos Hub One or more Kerberos Enterprise agents, can store their data directly on Kerberos Hub, and benefit from the visualisation layer Kerberos Hub offers. When doing this your recordings will be uploaded inside the Kerberos datacenter (which is a black box for you).
Kerberos Vault In addition to that you have the option to Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS), using Kerberos Vault.</description></item><item><title>Get Started</title><link>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/get-started/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/get-started/</guid><description>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Kerberos Storage, you will have the Kerberos Storage web app running. This web app allows you to administrate Kerberos Storage. You can add storage providers, queues, accounts, and more from a single interface. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that great.
Despite exposing a web app, Kerberos Storage also ships with a number of API&amp;rsquo;s. These API&amp;rsquo;s are exposed as, Swagger documentation, and can be used for extension and integration usecases. Think about following usecase.</description></item><item><title>Installation</title><link>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/installation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/installation/</guid><description>Just like Kerberos Enterprise, Kerberos Vault can be installed where Kubernetes can be installed. This means that it can run at the Edge - Baremetal -, in the cloud - VMs - or at Kubernetes service providers - SAAS - such as GCP, Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, and the list goes on.
Although you might except Kubernetes at the Edge or Kubernetes in the cloud, there are no differences, well sorry to say there are.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Installation</title><link>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/installation-cloud/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/installation-cloud/</guid><description>If not already the case, start by installing a Kubernetes cluster. This can be done on one of the hyperscalers (AWS, GCP or Azure), cloud providers (Digital Ocean, Scaleway, etc) or on-premise in your own private network.
Prerequisites Kerberos Vault is the storage component for Kerberos Enterprise. It is used to store your recordings at a central place, in the storage system you prefer. Next to that it can be used for extension and integration capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Edge Installation</title><link>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/installation-edge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/installation-edge/</guid><description>Welcome to the Kerberos Vault Edge installation. This is the way to go if you want to install Kerberos Vault on your Baremetal infrastructure or inside your Private Cloud.
Store your recordings at the edge with Kerberos Vault
Before we can actual start installing the different deployments in our cluster, we need to make sure we have one available.

These providers could be in the cloud like S3, Google Cloud Storage or Azure blob storage, or providers on premise such as Minio.
Depending on your use case: Kerberos Storage Cloud or Kerberos Storage Edge, you will opt for a specific storage provider. For example in the case Kerberos Storage Edge, it makes sense to store your recordings also at the edge.</description></item><item><title>Recycle</title><link>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/recycle/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/recycle/</guid><description>Next to storing your recordings, recycling up is also important. You have to avoid your disk being filled up and locking up the entire system and cluster, or you simply have to reduce cost. To make this possible we offer a recycle service called Kerberos Storage Recycle, which you can use to remove recordings based on different rules.
Recycling rules Different recycling rules can be configured in the Kerberos Storage app.</description></item><item><title>Releases</title><link>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/releases/releases/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://staging.doc.kerberos.live/vault/releases/releases/</guid><description>A license can be obtained by requesting a contract offert a cedric@verstraeten.io.
